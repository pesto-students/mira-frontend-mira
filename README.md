# MIRA - Frontend

MIRA is a lightweight task and project tracking tool, inspired by JIRA. It allows teams to track and manage software development projects through an easy-to-use web interface. This repository contains the frontend codebase for MIRA.

## Features

- Create and manage projects
- Create and assign tasks
- Interactive Kanban board for project management

## Frontend Tech Stack

The frontend of MIRA is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing in a React application.
- **Material-UI**: A UI component library for React that provides a set of customizable components following Material Design principles.
- **Redux Thunk**: A middleware for Redux that allows asynchronous actions using Redux.
- **Sentry**: An error monitoring and logging platform that helps track and debug application issues.

## Best Practices

The MIRA frontend codebase follows several best practices, including:

- **Modular component structure**: The codebase is organized into modular components, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse code.
- **Separation of concerns**: The codebase separates business logic from presentational components, promoting better code organization and testability.
- **Consistent coding style**: The codebase follows a consistent coding style and adheres to industry best practices to ensure readability and maintainability.
- **Use of Redux for state management**: Redux is used to manage application state, providing a predictable and centralized data flow.
- **Error handling and logging**: Sentry is integrated for error monitoring and logging, helping to track and debug issues in the application.
- **Responsive design**: The frontend is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
